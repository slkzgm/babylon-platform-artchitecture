# @babylon/shared-utils

Generic helpers and types shared across domains.

## Responsibilities

- No domain-specific rules
- Only generic utilities (types, formatting, validation, async helpers)
- Safe to import from any package

## Notes

- No domain rules or framework-specific code.
- Fully agnostic and reusable.
